### Production related equipment, hardware, software

Yes. We have budgets for Linux PCs, Apple machines, PHPStorm licenses and some more gizmos that you can need.

Other than that, if you need a device or license to speed up your work, just ask your team leader and we'll evaluate case by case.  
On standard hardware and software, please read [this section](/our-company/approved-hardware-and-software) to learn more.

### Books

Almost always **yes** if it's related to our work. The books will be added to our company bookshelf and will be available to all your colleage - you can obviously read them first ;)

Please mind you will be supposed to read them and maybe give your opinion or digest on the content during a brown-bag-something.

### Business cards

All management representative as well as salesmen and team leaders (basically all that will talk to the outside world on a daily basis) will have nominal BCs.

Non nominal BCs (i.e. with the company data and not your name on them) will be available for everybody to pick up at wish. Spread the love!

### Health/Posture facilities

We value your health so yes, as long as the budgets allows for everybody to have the same if they are in the need.  Legs raisers, laptop stands and even a standing desk are all things we can provide.  
Expensive stuff like adjustable desks and such may be evaluated on a case by case basis.

Obviously, if you suffer real desease, we'll do our best to acknowledge you all you need for a safe workplace. 

### Tickets for a conference

We always love to stay in the _consphere_.

If you attend the conference as a speaker, the company will grant you a full cost coverage.  
If you want to attend the con as a listener, please file your desire on Slack (#tech channel) so that everybody knows you want to attend and has an occasion to follow along.

Needless to say we have a budget for conferences too. Mind that if you are assigned a nominal ticket and you'll end up not attending the conference for personal reasons (left alone _force majeure_), we may decide to lower your requests in priority next time.

### A training course

More or less the same as above apply for training and courses. Anyway we like to arrange global courses for all the staff.

### Devices, toys and gizmos for test/experiment
