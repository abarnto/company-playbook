In SparkFabrik we make distinction between **Company Roles** and **Team roles**.

We don't have such a thing like **Job roles** since we are currently all developers, each one with its skill-level and focus, but pretty all devoted to create digital products. This basically means we won't hire for a _Project manager_. We probably will search for a more or less skilled technician and he will eventually end up doing what he does best.

The main difference between **Company roles** and **Team roles** is that the latter are generally interchangeable, while the formers tend to be fixed and company-wide. All Company roles are currently covered by company shareholders and founders.

## Company roles
