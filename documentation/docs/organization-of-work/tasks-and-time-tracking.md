## Basic principles

Working as a team, and loving order and focus, we want to keep track of all our tasks.  
There are a bunch of reasons for this:

1. Since our time on projects is charged to the customers, we want (!) them to know on what we spent our time
1. Having tracked tasks allow for project leaders, peers and customers to negotiate their priorities
1. We don't want ambiguity when we communicate: tracking tasks we can refer them with piercing precision using IDs
1. When a task is properly tracked and described, everybody in the team can work it out (trading off efficiency for efficacy maybe, but still)

At the same extent, we want to track the time we spend on task so that:

1. We can report it to client
1. We know if we are exceeding our budget or more basically how much we have spent
1. We can have metrics related to tasks life-cycles, etc.

We **don't want** metrics about velocity or productivity of single persons! Everyone has her own pace.  
Velocity rates are kept into consideration for the whole team, with the goal to continuously improve its effectiveness, remove obstacles, make them work less to produce more, etc.

We appreciate people who sets personal goals on proficiency or productivity but we don't think it as a matter of sheer speed, so time is only one of the variables, not even the most important. Please, keep this in mind.

### Tracking tasks

We have [an instance of Redmine](https://projects.sparkfabrik.com) in place, with a bunch of nice additions to manage projects with agile methodologies and enforce our habits.  

    @todo We also use Redmine to expose an issue tracker to the customers who pay support agreements, so they can open support tickets directly. We may be amending this practice or review it. Until then we'll skip this use case in this document.

You must have credentials to log into our tracker and work on projects. What follows describes basic issue workflow and anatomy. Please find a list of useful recipes to perform basic-to-advanced tasks at the end of this chapter.
